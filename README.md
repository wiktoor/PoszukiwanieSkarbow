Program for my *C++* class. Our goal was to write a program using C++ features such as [templates](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/templates), [constraints and concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints) (introduced in C++20). The program is supposed to do all the computation during the compile time (using [constexpr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr), [constinit](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constinit) and [consteval](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/consteval) specifiers).
